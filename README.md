# Scan Order Pay App

This app is one part of a bigger system and this one is built out of the clients perspective.
An app from the service perspective needs to be build, too.

The SOP app idea came up since I love to go out to eat. But after serving your order you get forgotten as a client quite often. Looking and waving to ask either for re-order or at least for the bill was making me think on how to make this even more convenient.

I need to scan a code in the beginning anyway either to put in my details or to look through the menu. So why not order and pay through an app right away?

After you scan the code you will be directed to the menu page, where you can scroll through the menu and choose your food and quantity.
In the next page (called order page) you have an overview of the items you chose from the menu. You can remove items and see the current total amount. You need to confirm the order, which guides you to a confirmation page.

The last page is the bill page. It only updates the bill after confirming any order. The order page will be cleared and is ready for ordering additional items. After confirming the bill page, you will be guided to another confirmatino page.

The best part is that you don't need to look and wave for the service's attention anymore - just use the service button, which is shown on every page.
